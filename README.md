# ðŸŽ¯ Naive Bayes Classifier (GaussianNB) with Scikit-learn

This project shows how to build a **Naive Bayes Classifier** using Python's `scikit-learn`.  
We generate synthetic data, train the model, visualize the decision boundaries, and predict class probabilities.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Generate synthetic datasets using `make_blobs`
- Train a **Gaussian Naive Bayes** classifier
- Visualize decision boundaries and classifications
- Predict class probabilities for new data points
